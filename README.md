# Cost-Effectiveness Plane Challenge
This challenge is to write code in R or Stata to generate a cost-effectiveness plane using the dataset saved in the file results.csv that is located in the data directory.

Use a willingness-to-pay threshold of $96,000.

The first step is to create a local copy of this repository on your local machine. You can do this by either:

- forking this repository to your GitHub account and then cloning that repository to your machine (only do this if you know how to use git and GitHub); or

- click on the green "Code" button and choose the "Download Zip" option, then unzip the contents of the downloaded file to your machine.

If you are writing code in Stata you can then write your code as either a Do file, a dyndoc text file or a StataMarkdown file. Read the instructions in the README files in the relevant directory (Stata/Do, Stata/dydndoc or Stata/StataMarkdown).

If you are writing code in R you have the option to write a simple script (.R file), a literate program (using RMarkdown), a function (.R file) or a Shiny app. Read the instructions in the README files in the relevant directory (R/Scripts, r/RMarkdown, R/Functions or R/Shiny).

When you have completed your work you can either:

- make a pull request to this repository (if you know how to use GitHub); or

- email a zip directory of your work to Matt or Andrea.

Bonus points for making the plots pretty!

The intention is to discuss the different approaches for meeting this challenge at our next meeting of Coding Club.
