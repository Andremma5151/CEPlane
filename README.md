# Cost-Effectiveness Plane Challenge
This challenge is to write code in R or Stata to generate a cost-effectiveness plane using the dataset saved in the file results.csv that is located in the data directory.

Use a willingness to pay threshold of $96,000.

If you are writing code in Stata you can write code as either a Do file, a dyndoc text file or a StataMarkdown file. Read the instructions in the README files in the relevant directory (Stata/Do, Stata/dydndoc or Stata/StataMarkdown).

If you are writing code in R you have the option to write a simple script (.R file), a literate program (using RMarkdown), a function (.R file) or a Shiny app. Read the instructions in the README files in the relevant directory (R/Scripts, r/RMarkdown, R/Functions or R/Shiny).

When you have completed your work you can either:

- make a pull request to this repository (if you know how to use GitHub); or

- email a zip directory of your work to Matt or Andrea.

Bonus points for making the plots pretty!

The intention is to discuss the different approaches for meeting this challenge at our next meeting of Coding Club.
